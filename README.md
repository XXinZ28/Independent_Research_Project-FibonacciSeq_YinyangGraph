# About the Paper

This repository archives the markdown files I compiled to complete my independent research project, which is a 44-page-long research paper I wrote when I studied abroad in Geneva with the guidance of a PhD student at the Geneva Graduate Institute. The paper is a comparative analysis aiming to investigate the similarities and differences between ancient Chinese and early Greek philosophy through the lens of mathematics, using the Fibonacci sequence and Yin-yang diagram as examples. 


# About the Files

I categorized files into three piles. Under the `Fibseq_statistics`, you will find all the coding I made to output the table. Under the `Fibseq_table_output`, you will find the HTML for all the tables, which are also linked in the paper. Lastly, you will find the final paper in PDF format for your interest of reference.
