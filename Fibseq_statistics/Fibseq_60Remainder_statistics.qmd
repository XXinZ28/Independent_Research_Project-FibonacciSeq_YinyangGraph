*Purpose of this document*
This file contains the calculation of remainder in the first 60 terms in Fibonacci Sequence. 

*Property Reference*
Here are the known property for Remainders in Pisano Period for reference: 
    1. Each number when divided by 10, the last one digit is the remainder, the last digits of fib seq have a pattern of length 60. 
    2. When divided by 100, which means are looking at the last two digits, the last two digits are the remainder -> have the pattern of length 300 of repetition.
    3. When looking at the last three digits(divided by 1000), the last three digits are the remainder -> have the pattern of length 1500 of repetition. 

We can know the next remainder by adding up the previous two remainders. 
    1. When 0 and 1 are next to each other(b/c this is divisible by 5), then 1+ 1 = 2, (0,1,1,2) and that's the beginning of fibonacci numbers and it carries on, to restart the cycle! (0 and 1 are the big triggers?). 
    2. The modulus Fibbonacci sequences had the same additive property as the normal Fibbonacci.

# Function to generate Fibonacci sequence
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  fib <- numeric(n)
  fib[1] <- 0
  fib[2] <- 1
  for (i in 3:n) {
    fib[i] <- fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
  }
  return(fib)
}

# Calculate Fibonacci sequence up to the 60th term
fib_sequence <- fibonacci(60)

# Divide each number by 10 and show the remainder
remainders <- fib_sequence %% 10

# Create a data frame for the Fibonacci sequence and remainders
fib_df <- data.frame(Position = 1:60, Fibonacci_Numbers = fib_sequence, Final_Digit = remainders)

# Print the table in the requested format
fib_table <- kable(fib_df, format = "markdown", align = "c") %>%
  add_header_above(header = c( "Final Digits of Fibonacci Numbers, 60 Code" = 3), font = 20)

styled_mod_table <- kable_styling(fib_table, full_width = FALSE)

styled_mod_table <- column_spec(styled_mod_table, 1, extra_css = "border-right: 1px solid #CCCCCC;")

print(styled_mod_table)
